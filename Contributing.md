# How to contribute

We love pull requests. And following this guidelines will make your pull request easier to merge.

_[Use GitHub interface](https://blog.sapegin.me/all/open-source-for-everyone/) for simple documentation changes, otherwise follow the steps below._

## Prerequisites

- If it’s your first pull request, watch [this amazing course](http://makeapullrequest.com/) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds).
- Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` & `docker-compose pull` .

**Please update npm lock file (`package-lock.json`) if you add or update dependencies.**

## Other notes

- If you have commit access to repository and want to make big change or not sure about something, make a new branch and open pull request.
- We’re using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format code, so don’t worry much about code formatting.
- Don’t commit generated files, like minified JavaScript.
- Don’t change version number and change log.

## Need help?

If you want to contribute but have any questions, concerns or doubts, feel free to ping maintainers. Ideally create a pull request with `WIP` (Work in progress) in its title and ask questions in the pull request description.
